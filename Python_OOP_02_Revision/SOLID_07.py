SOLID
1. Single Responsibility:
- each class is responsible for only one thing and should have only one reason to change

2. Open/Closed (opened for extension, closed for modification):
- software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extensions, but closed for modifications

3. Liskov Substitution
4. Interface Segregation
5. Dependency Inversion
