@singleton/creational/ - /useful for logs/ - ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access for it
abstract factory/creational/ - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class
factory method/creational/  - define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Let a class defer instantiation to subclasses
builder/creational/ - separate the construction of a complex object from its representing so that the same construction process
can create different representations.
